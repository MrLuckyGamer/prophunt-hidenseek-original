# Prop Hunt (Hide'n'Seek) - Original #
Prop Hunt plays much like a Hide and Seek. Players on the RED team, disguised as props, are given a 30 second set up time to hide, and afterwards players on the BLUE team must find and kill them in the given time period. At the end of each round, teams are swapped: Hunters (BLUE) become the Hunted (RED) and vice versa. Respawns aren’t permitted until the end of each round.

A: Do you have Garry’s mod? If not, then purchase the game. 

Q: Why do I need Garry’s mod for Prop Hunt to work? 
A: Well, Actually Prop Hunt is a gamemode addon for Garry's Mod. 

Q: Do I need something else to play? 
A: This gamemode might require CS:S for some props/maps. Anyway if you bought GMOD with CS:S you're ready to go ;) 

Q: How do I disguise as a prop? 
A: You need to be in the "hiders" team, obviously. If so, place yourself in front of a prop and press 'E'. 

Q: How do I swap team? 
A: Just press 'F2'

Q: I don't know ho this works! 
A: Check out the discussion "Help for Newer Players." by "☾ ILikeStargates ٣٩٤#" 

Q: There are error symbols and purple-black checkerboard .-. 
A: Check out the discussion "Solution for error symbols and purple-black checkerboard." 

Q: How do I play the game? 
A: You need at least one player in each team (Props and Hunters). The props (initially with Dr. Kleiner's skin) need to choose a prop in the current map and press 'E' to disguise as it. The Hunters need to find and kill them by shooting suspicious objects. If a hunter shoots an enemy team component, he gains some life points, elseif it loses some. 

Q: How do I use the fretta map vote? 
A: Actually, it's still a beta in this mod, I'm trying to fix it. Now you can only manually select a map from server list.
